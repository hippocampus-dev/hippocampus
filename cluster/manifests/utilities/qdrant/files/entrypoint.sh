# Script to run qdrant in docker container and handle contingencies, like OOM.
# The functioning logic is as follows:
# - If recovery mode is allowed, we check if qdrant was killed during initialization or not.
#   - If it was killed during initialization, we remove run qdrant in recovery mode
#   - If it was killed after initialization, do nothing and restart container
# - If recovery mode is not allowed, we just restart container
