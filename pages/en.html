<div class="line-block">Senior Principal Engineer | Tokyo, Japan |
Apr. 2015 - Present |</div>
<p>I have consistently worked in the Platform Engineering domain to
deliver scalable impact in realizing the corporate message “Make all
LIFEs FULL.”</p>
<p>Immediately after joining as a new graduate in 2015, I was assigned
to a team handling AWS migration accompanying Microservices
transformation. I led zero-downtime migrations of numerous web servers
and data stores, as well as the architectural renewal of Solr, the
full-text search engine that forms the core of the business.</p>
<p>Concerned about the reinvention of the wheel caused by Microservices
transformation, I proposed the adoption of a Kubernetes-based PaaS that
I had been developing as a hobby, launched the team in 2018, and have
been growing it as a platform that extends beyond Kubernetes to this
day.</p>

<li>Launch, development, and technical management of internal PaaS team
<ul>
<li>From the team’s launch in 2018 to the present, I have served as Tech
Lead, handling not only development but also member training and team
building, managing everything except people management such as
performance reviews</li>
<li>Since 2020, we have been accepting members from the Sapporo
development site, establishing a remote work environment as a
multi-location team with Tokyo</li>

<li>Development and operation of KEEL, a Kubernetes-based internal PaaS
<ul>
<li>Built on multi-tenant, single-cluster Kubernetes aimed at cost
optimization through resource consolidation, adopted service mesh with
Istio since version 0.2.0, and supports serverless workloads with
Knative</li>
<li>Equipped with an observability platform using Prometheus, Thanos,

<li>Development of general-purpose AI agent implementation for product
integration and LLMOps
<ul>
<li>At the release timing of gpt-3.5-turbo, I proactively developed a
general-purpose AI agent implementing what is now known as an Agent
Loop, anticipating future product integration and LLMOps as a
platform</li>
<li>Simultaneously released an internal general-purpose chatbot using
this agent, which, along with deployment to group companies, <a

and 42,000 hours of work time reduction as of October 2024</a></li>
<li>Widely used by products due to rate limiting, robust error handling,
and comprehensive observability</li>

<li>Development of code generator to realize PaaS experience
<ul>
<li>By entering required fields for Custom Resource Definition and
executing, automatically generates everything needed for application
development cycle including not only Kubernetes Manifests but also
operational documentation, various GitHub Actions, monitoring settings,
dashboards, and deployment settings including Content Trust for J-SOX
compliance</li>
<li>As a code generator, it can opt-in to repositories not using
Kubernetes, and has been deployed to all actively developed internal
repositories to reuse the Content Trust mechanism and various GitHub
Actions, maintaining all repositories in a healthy state through
self-update functionality</li>

<ul>
<li>Provides boilerplates for Go, TypeScript, and Python equipped with
OpenTelemetry, Graceful Shutdown, structured logging, profiling, and
optimal Dockerfiles to support platform users</li>
<li>Combined with the aforementioned code generator, using the
boilerplate enables setup in 5 minutes</li>
<li>Over 90% of new development repositories use these boilerplates</li>
