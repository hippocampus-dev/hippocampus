# Hippocampus Server Configuration Example
#
# This configuration file uses internally tagged enums for storage backends.
# Each section specifies its type via the "kind" field, with additional
# fields specific to that backend type.

# Token Storage Configuration
# Options: "File", "SQLite" (with sqlite feature), "GCS" (with gcs feature), "Cassandra" (with cassandra feature)
[TokenStorage]
kind = "File"
path = "/var/hippocampus/tokens"

# SQLite example:
# [TokenStorage]
# kind = "SQLite"
# path = "/var/hippocampus/tokens.db"

# GCS example (requires gcs feature):
# [TokenStorage]
# kind = "GCS"
# bucket = "my-bucket"
# prefix = "tokens"
# service_account_key_path = "/path/to/service-account-key.json"

# Cassandra example (requires cassandra feature):
# [TokenStorage]
# kind = "Cassandra"
# address = "127.0.0.1:9042"

# Document Storage Configuration
# Options: "File", "SQLite" (with sqlite feature)
[DocumentStorage]
kind = "File"
path = "/var/hippocampus/documents"

# SQLite example:
# [DocumentStorage]
# kind = "SQLite"
# path = "/var/hippocampus/documents.db"

# Tokenizer Configuration
# Options: "Lindera", "Whitespace", "Wasm" (with wasm feature)
[Tokenizer]
kind = "Lindera"

# Whitespace example:
# [Tokenizer]
# kind = "Whitespace"

# Wasm example (requires wasm feature):
# [Tokenizer]
# kind = "Wasm"
# path = "/path/to/tokenizer.wasm"

# Schema Configuration
